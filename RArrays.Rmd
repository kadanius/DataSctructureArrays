## WHAT IS AN ARRAY

An array is a data structure that can hold multi-dimensional data. In R, the array is objects that can hold two or more than two-dimensional data.

Arrays can store the values having only a similar kind of data types. The data can be more than one dimensional, where there are rows and columns and dimensions of some length.

Below is an example of how we create an array:


## Vector

We first create vectors as below

v1<-c(1:12) 
v2<-c(21:32) 
```
v2
```


## CREATING MATRICES

Below, we are creating matrix1(M
```1) and matrix2(M2) and assign them with vectors we created above

{r}
M1<-matrix(v1,nrow = 3, ncol= 4,byrow = TRUE)
M2<-matrix(v2,nrow=3, ncol=4, byrow=TRUE)

```
## CREATING AN ARRAY

First we create names and info for labels of both rows and columns
We also create an array called M3

```
{r}
names<-c("Danny","Kanye","Victor","Daud")
info<-c("height","Shoesize","Marks")
M3<-array(c(M1,M2),dim = c(3,4), dimnames =list(names,info))
print(M3)
```
